					<p class="fw-bolder h4">What's Pigeon Racing?</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="fw-bolder">Answer</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, pigeon racing is a hobby that is deadly to the birds used. Racing hobbyists strive to selectively breed or purchase champions. They control every aspect of care in an effort to increase their chances of winning. Pigeon racers then release millions of domestic racing pigeons, hundreds of miles from their homes, in competitions most of the birds won’t survive. The birds aren’t racing at all. They are just flying their hearts out, trying to get back to their home. A great many will never get home; they will die trying. Pigeon racers will tell you the birds that don’t make it home join up with flocks of feral Rock Pigeons. But this is true for only a very, very few. Check every pigeon flock you see for banded birds. (Racing pigeons are banded. Learn about bands.) You’ll rarely ever see one. Pigeon racers will tell you that feral pigeons die too. Yes. We all die. But pigeon racers need to take responsibility for the needless suffering and deaths caused by their hobby. (The hobbyists actually kill lots of their own birds by culling the “inferior” or weak or ill; read The Secret of the Champions.) Don’t breed animals and use them for your amusement. Don’t risk their lives for your fun. And, if you do, at least own it. Say yes, I know racing kills pigeons but I like it and I do it anyway. Read more here.</p>

				</div>

					<p class="fw-bolder">Answer</p>
					<p>How Do Pigeons’ Feet Get Injured? How Do Pigeons’ Feet Get Injured? Anyone who watches urban pigeons has probably noticed birds with injured or missing toes and feet. One of the most common problems that feral pigeons have is something we call “stringfoot.” Pigeons need twigs, straw or hay to build nests, but in urban areas, they are more likely to find string, wire and human hair. When they spend 12 hours of every day for 3 weeks out of every month in their nests, their toes become entangled in the nest materials, which leads to constriction, necrosis, infection, etc. If you can catch and untangle these poor birds, they can recover and survive very well, even with missing toes or stumps for feet.</p>

					<p class="fw-bolder h4">How to Care for a Rescued Pet Pigeon (for Newbies)</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p class="fw-bolder">Answer</p>
					<p>If I had my way, there would be no pet pigeons, amazing as they are. They would all be wild and free. I don’t believe that birds should be domesticated, bred and used by people for any reason. But, because people do breed, use and lose unreleasable pigeons, there are a great many that are found lost, injured, starved or all of the above. I’m writing these guidelines on pigeon care for those birds and the compassionate people who help them. Get Help from a Pigeon-Friendly Expert Pigeons are easy to care for but my first bit of advice is to always connect with a pigeon-friendly expert to get help assessing the bird’s condition. If you have rescued a juvenile Rock Pigeon (wild rather than domestic), he needs to get to a pigeon-friendly wildlife rescue! Don’t keep that wild child and make him a captive pet nor think you’re well suited to prepare him for release. You run a very high risk of ruining that baby’s chance to live as a free and wild pigeon (and there are already too few homes for unreleasable pigeons). You can find help by contacting wildlife rescues, avian vets or bird rescues. Ask if they are “pigeon friendly.” Some will be, some won’t (Rock Pigeons and domestic pigeons are non-native and unprotected so many institutions kill them as “nuisance animals” rather than help them). Here’s a map of just a few of the pigeon-friendly rescues in the US. (There are more out there, we’re just starting to populate this map). Too often, despite good intentions, pigeons that we are trying to help, suffer and die because their needs, injuries or illness went unrecognized, untreated or mistreated. I highly recommend connecting with experienced rescuers and adopters in our Palomacy Help Group. It is the best and fastest way to get assistance. Post photos of the bird, your location and questions and you’ll get fast help. People often contact me saying, “I found a pigeon, she’s so tame and calm” and that tells me she is very likely weak, emaciated, injured or all of the above. Please- get the benefit of some expert guidance to help you help the pigeon!</p>
